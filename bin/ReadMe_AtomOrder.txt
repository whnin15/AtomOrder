This project will need the user input for two files, one reference file and another file (both with directory) that needs to correct the atoms' order. The atoms' order in the second file will be corrected based on the order in the reference file.

The output files are put in the same directory with filenames as
- 2LWC_Model1_aa.pdb ... 2LWC_Model20_aa.pdb
- 1PLW_Model1_aa.pdb  ... 1PLW_Model80_aa.pdb
- 1PLX_Model1_aa.pdb   ... 1PLX_Model80_aa.pdb

The reference file used for testing was 2LWC_Model1.pdb and the input file changed was Merged_1PLW+1PLX+2LWC.pdb.
